title: Inktober 2019
---

This year I finally decided to have another go at kick-starting my drawing by participating in the yearly October drawing event called [Inktober](https://inktober.com/). It was originally created by a favorite artist of mine named [Jake Parker](http://mrjakeparker.com/) to promote improving skills and developing positive drawing habits.

I have tried (and failed) many times over the years to try and get back into drawing. So having not really drawn anytihng since school, I was really happy with how this month turned out. And I am proud that I was able to finish with a drawing per day. Only time will tell if this exercise helped create a lasting habit. But I am hopeful!
