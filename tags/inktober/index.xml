It was originally created by a favorite artist of mine named Jake Parker to promote improving skills and developing positive drawing habits.
I have tried (and failed) many times over the years to try and get back into drawing. So having not really drawn anytihng since school, I was really happy with how this month turned out.</description></item></channel></rss>
