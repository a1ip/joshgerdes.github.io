This allows all my content to live in static files and be built automatically by GitHub. My hope is that with this simplification (and automation) I might actually post a little more this year.
During the conversion process I decided that I liked the theme I was currently using with Ghost but found it was not available for Jekyll yet.</description></item></channel></rss>
